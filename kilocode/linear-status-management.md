# Linear Status Management

## Status Mapping
- **Todo**: Initial state for new issues.
- **In Progress**: When work begins (branch created).
- **In Review**: When a PR is opened/pushed.
- **Done**: When the PR is merged.

## Automation
- The assistant should attempt to update these statuses automatically when performing the corresponding actions (creating branch, pushing, merging).
