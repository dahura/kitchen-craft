# Auto Linear Issue Creation

This rule guides the assistant whenever the user explicitly asks to **create a bug, feature or task** (in Russian or English). It should analyse the given description and file a Linear issue with sensible defaults.

## Trigger phrases
• "создай баг" / "создать баг"
• "создай фичу" / "создать фичу"
• "создай задачу"
• "create bug"
• "create feature"
• "create task"

## Language
All Linear issues (title and description) must be created in **English**, regardless of the language used by the user. The assistant should translate the user's request into English before filing the issue.

If any of these phrases (case-insensitive) appear at the beginning of the user message, treat it as a request to file an issue.

## Required fields for Linear
1. **Title** –  Use the first sentence or concise summary of the problem/feature.
2. **Description** –  Full user-provided details plus any analysis.
3. **Team** –  Default to the `Kitchen-Craft` team (ID: `KC`) unless the user specifies another.
4. **State** –  `Backlog` for features, `Triage` for bugs.
5. **Priority** (if missing)
   • Bugs:  Urgent (1) if it blocks core workflow, otherwise High (2).
   • Features:  Normal (3) unless user indicates urgency.
6. **Labels** –  Add `bug` or `feature` automatically.
7. **Due date** –  
   • Urgent bug → today +1 day.
   • High priority → today +3 days.
   • Normal → today +14 days.

## Procedure
1. Parse user message → decide **type** (bug vs feature) & extract any explicit fields (priority, labels, due date, team).
2. Fill missing fields using the defaults above.
3. Call `mcp_Linear_create_issue` with assembled parameters.
4. Confirm creation back to the user with the issue URL.
