# Package Manager Guideline – Bun

The Kitchen-Craft repository is standardized on the [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime and package manager:

• All `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm` commands in documentation or scripts should be replaced with their `bun` equivalents (e.g. `bun install`, `bun add react`).
• New dependencies must be added via `bun add <pkg>` so that they appear in `bun.lock`.
• Do **not** commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` updates; only `bun.lock` is authoritative.
• CI/CD pipelines execute `bun install` followed by the build/test steps.
• If scripts in `package.json` rely on Node, ensure they run under Bun or include `--bun` where required.

This rule helps the AI keep consistency with the chosen package manager when modifying documentation, scripts or dependencies.
