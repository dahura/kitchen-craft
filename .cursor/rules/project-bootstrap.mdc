# 🚀 Cursor Project Bootstrap Rules (Starter)

These rules help you bootstrap a **brand-new** repo with both *Cursor ⇄ Linear* and *Kilocode ⇄ Linear* automation. Copy **this single file** into `.cursor/rules/`, open the project in Cursor, and the assistant will execute every step below.

> 🔄 **Kilocode Support:** Whenever rules are generated, you get two variants: Cursor (`.mdc` under `.cursor/rules/`) and Kilocode (`.md` under `kilocode/`). Content stays in sync; only the formats differ.

---

## 1. Automatic Linear project creation

1. On the assistant’s first interaction with the repo, it checks Linear for a project whose name matches the repo directory.
2. If no project exists, the assistant calls:
   ```typescript
   create_project {
     name: <directory_name>,
     team: "engineering",
     summary: "Auto-bootstrapped by Cursor",
   }
   ```
3. The resulting project ID is stored in the memory bank under `linear.projectId` for future requests.

> 🔒 Security: make sure `LINEAR_API_KEY` is configured in Cursor before opening the project.

## 2. Standard task workflow

### 2.1 Issue creation
* Any user message containing *bug*, *feature*, or *task* automatically creates a Linear issue (unless the user opts out) and sets status to *Todo*.
* The issue title comes from the request text; the description summarizes the conversation.
* The issue links to the project referenced by `linear.projectId`.

### 2.2 Local development flow
1. When work starts, the assistant:
   * moves the issue to *In Progress*;
   * creates a branch named `<ISSUE_KEY>-<kebab-title>`.
2. Commit messages must begin with `[<ISSUE_KEY>]`.
3. Pushing the branch moves the issue to *In Review* and opens a draft PR.
4. Merging the PR sets the issue to *Done* and removes the branch.

## 3. Memory and commentary
* Follow the guidance in `memory-bank-guidelines.mdc` when you need to persist architectural decisions or context.

---

## 4. Project invariants

* **Package manager:** `bun`. Always convert `npm|yarn|pnpm` commands to `bun`.
* **Branch naming:** `<ISSUE_KEY>-<slug>`.
* **CI path:** `bun install && bun run test`.

---

## 5. “Bootstrap the project” command

After copying this file, simply tell the assistant:

```
bootstrap the project
```

The assistant will:
1. Create the Linear project (if missing).
2. Generate supporting rule files for **Cursor** (in `.mdc` format):
   * `.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc`
   * `.cursor/rules/auto-linear-issue.mdc`
   * `.cursor/rules/local-task-workflow.mdc`
   * `.cursor/rules/linear-status-management.mdc`
3. Generate equivalent rules for **Kilocode** (in `.md` format under `kilocode/`):
   * `kilocode/development-workflow.md`
   * `kilocode/auto-linear-issue.md`
   * `kilocode/local-task-workflow.md`
   * `kilocode/linear-status-management.md`
4. Initialize a baseline `README.md`.

### Generated files at a glance

#### Cursor (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc` | Git-flow, code review, PR templates |
| `.cursor/rules/auto-linear-issue.mdc` | Auto-create issues from user prompts |
| `.cursor/rules/linear-status-management.mdc` | Map actions to Linear status updates |
| `.cursor/rules/local-task-workflow.mdc` | Testing, linting, and incremental commits |

#### Kilocode (`kilocode/*.md`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `kilocode/development-workflow.md` | Git-flow, code review, PR templates (Kilocode format) |
| `kilocode/auto-linear-issue.md` | Auto-create issues from user prompts (Kilocode format) |
| `kilocode/linear-status-management.md` | Map actions to Linear status updates (Kilocode format) |
| `kilocode/local-task-workflow.md` | Testing, linting, and incremental commits (Kilocode format) |

> 📝 **Note:** Kilocode uses plain `.md` files stored in `.kilocode/`. The content mirrors the `.mdc` rules so both tools stay aligned.

🎉 You can now manage issues conversationally and let the automation handle everything from Linear status updates to branch hygiene.
